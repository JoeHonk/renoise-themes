# renoise-themes

Trying to make myself feel more at home, I decided to create some color themes for Renoise. One is color-for-color a replica of the old Impulse Tracker Vintage theme, which may itself be based off ST3. The other is Impulse Tracker's Industrial theme, which is a bit closer to the Renoise default for those of you who prefer to express yourself in shades of gray.
